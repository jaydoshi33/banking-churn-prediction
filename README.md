# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges across industries, particularly in **banking, telecom, retail, and subscription-based businesses**. This project leverages **machine learning models** to predict whether a customer is likely to leave, empowering organizations to proactively design retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline for:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Performance optimization for real-world scenarios  

---

## 🎯 Scope & Objectives
- Identify key factors that contribute to customer churn.  
- Build a predictive model to classify customers into **churn vs. non-churn** categories.  
- Provide explainability (feature importance) to guide business decisions.  
- Deploy a framework that can be extended to **banking, insurance, telecom, retail, and SaaS industries**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.  
- **Visualization:** Correlation heatmaps, churn distribution, feature importance

## 📊 Impact on Industries

### Banking & Financial Services
- Detect high-risk customers likely to switch banks or default on products.  
- Enable **personalized retention offers**, credit risk mitigation, and loyalty programs.  

### Telecom
- Predict churn in prepaid/postpaid subscribers.  
- Reduce marketing spend by **targeting only at-risk customers**.  

### Retail & eCommerce
- Retain customers in subscription models (Amazon Prime, Walmart+).  
- Anticipate customer drop-offs and optimize promotions.  

### SaaS & Tech
- Improve **customer lifetime value (CLV)** by reducing subscription cancellations.  
- Provide insights to **product and customer success teams**.  

---

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved **high accuracy and F1-score** on test data.  
- Feature analysis revealed **key drivers of churn** such as transaction activity, customer engagement, and service usage patterns.  
- Demonstrated that **proactive retention strategies** can save millions in revenue.  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integration with **real-time streaming data** (Kafka, Spark).  
- Deployment of churn prediction API with **FastAPI / Flask**.  
- Use of **Deep Learning** (LSTMs for sequential data).  
- Explainability with **SHAP / LIME** for business adoption.
